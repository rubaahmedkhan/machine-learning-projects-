# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects that I have worked on, covering a wide range of topics including data preprocessing, classification, regression, natural language processing, and more. Each project folder contains its own code, datasets, and relevant documentation.

## Projects List

1. **Resume Screening using Machine Learning**
   - Automated resume screening using a trained ML model.
   - **Technologies**: Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK.

2. **Heart Disease Prediction**
   - Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient features using a logistic regression model.
   - **Technologies**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.

3. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on various health metrics using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
