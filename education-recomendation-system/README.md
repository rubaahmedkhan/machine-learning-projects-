# Education Recommendation System

This project implements an **Education Recommendation System** using multiple machine learning classifiers to suggest personalized educational content or courses. The system predicts the most suitable courses for students based on their profiles and historical data.

## Models Used

The following machine learning classifiers were implemented and tested for the recommendation system:

- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for binary or multi-class classification tasks.
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: A powerful model for both linear and non-linear decision boundaries.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees and merges them for more accurate predictions.
- **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, non-parametric algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A tree-based model that splits data into subsets to predict outcomes.
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier that assumes features follow a Gaussian distribution.
- **AdaBoost Classifier**: A boosting algorithm that combines weak classifiers to improve overall classification performance.
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Another boosting technique that fits new models to the residuals of previous ones, focusing on difficult-to-classify data points.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: A highly efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting, optimized for speed and performance.
